# my-expenses-app
A web application to control my expenses

You can check my other branch *frontest* to see a full frontend version of the app

*Originally the backend of this app was done in Flask, but later it was changed to Node.js*

**# How To Run:**

1. Install Node.js
2. Clone the repository
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the *api* folder
4. Now run `npm install` to install all dependencies of the backend
5. Now type `cd ..` and run `npm install` again to install the dependencies of the front
6. Finally run `npm start` to run the app
